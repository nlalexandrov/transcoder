It is generaly a good idea to plan your installation. As a frined on mine says "If you fail to plan ... you plan to fail!"

Kamailio parameters 
	Signaling IP address and port where kamailio will bind :
		ISTEN_ADDRESS : 127.0.0.1
		LISTEN_PORT : 5070

	Transcoding port resources :
		POOLS_START - the first port of the transcoding RTP pool range
		POOL_SIZE - the size (in number of ports) that each worker thread will use
		NUMBER_OF_WORKERS - how many worker threads we want
